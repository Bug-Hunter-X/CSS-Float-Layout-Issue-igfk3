# CSS Float Layout Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with using `float` in CSS.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution. The problem occurs when floating elements cause unexpected behavior, often due to the parent element not having a defined width.

The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue is that `float: left` can cause unexpected layout issues if not properly handled. If the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the floated elements might overlap or cause the parent to collapse.
